An interactive stopwatch is a web-based tool that allows users to track elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It provides an intuitive interface with buttons to start, stop, reset, and record laps, giving users full control over their time tracking. This is achieved by combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Components of the Stopwatch:
HTML Structure:

Timer Display: This is where the elapsed time is shown, typically in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds).
Control Buttons:
Start: Starts the stopwatch, begins counting the time.
Stop: Stops the stopwatch, freezing the time.
Reset: Resets the stopwatch back to 00:00:00.000 and clears the lap times.
Lap: Records the current time as a lap, allowing users to track multiple time intervals without resetting the stopwatch.
Theme Toggle: A checkbox to switch between a light or dark theme for the stopwatch interface.
CSS Styling:

Themes: CSS variables define light and dark themes, allowing the background, text color, and button styles to change based on the user’s choice.
Button Styles: Buttons are styled with colors and hover effects to make them visually interactive. When the user hovers over a button, it changes color, and when clicked, it glows to provide immediate feedback.
Timer Display: The timer display has a clean and bold appearance, with the current time shown in a large font. It also changes color or style to match the selected theme.
Lap Times: When a lap is recorded, it's added to a list that is styled to distinguish each lap time with proper spacing and borders.
JavaScript Functionality:

Time Calculation: The stopwatch uses Date.now() to get the current time in milliseconds and tracks elapsed time by calculating the difference between the current time and the time when the stopwatch started.
Start Button: When the start button is pressed, the stopwatch begins counting from zero, and an interval updates the display every 10 milliseconds (for precise time tracking).
Stop Button: Stops the countdown, and the time is stored in a variable called elapsedTime so that the user can resume or record laps.
Reset Button: Resets all the values to their initial state (00:00:00.000) and clears the lap list.
Lap Button: Records the current time as a lap, adds it to a list of lap times, and displays them in the order they were recorded.
